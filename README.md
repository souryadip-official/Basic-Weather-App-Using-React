# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

This project is a **Weather App** I designed to strengthen my skills in **React.js**. It fetches **real-time weather data** from an API and provides a clean, user-friendly interface to display the information.

## Features
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Search for any location and get up-to-date weather details.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern React Practices**: Built with reusable components and state management.

## Motivation
This project was built to enhance my understanding of:
- **React.js Concepts**: Component-based architecture, state, and props.
- **API Integration**: Fetching external data with `fetch`
